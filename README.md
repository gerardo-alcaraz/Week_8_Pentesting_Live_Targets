# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: SQL Injection

/salespeople/show.php?id=5 -> /salespeople/show.php?id=' OR SLEEP(5)=0--'

Used the "' OR SLEEP(5)=0--'" sql statement that CodePath recommended.

Vulnerability #2: Session Hijacking/Fixation


Used the tool recommended from CodePath.  Used Chrome to login to account.  Then used FireFox to change my session Id to that of Chrome's then I was able to get access to the site.
