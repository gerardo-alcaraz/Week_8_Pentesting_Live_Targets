# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: SQL Injection

/salespeople/show.php?id=5 -> /salespeople/show.php?id=' OR SLEEP(5)=0--'

Used the "' OR SLEEP(5)=0--'" sql statement that CodePath recommended.

Vulnerability #2: Session Hijacking/Fixation


Used the tool recommended from CodePath.  Used Chrome to login to account.  Then used FireFox to change my session Id to that of Chrome's then I was able to get access to the site.

## Green

Vulnerability #1: Enumeration

When a valid username is entered the error message is bold.  If an invalid username is enter the error message isn't bold.

Vulnerability #2: Cross-Site Scripting

I used the recommended "<script>alert('Mallory found the XSS!');</script>" script given to us by CodePath.  I replaced "Mallory with Sean Ranklin.  The gif didn't record my input of the script but a dialog appears that has the name Sean Ranklin indicating that the script was successful.

## Red

Vulnerability #1: Insecure Direct Object Referennce

You can input any number after the id= in the address bar.  Since the numbers are low one can enter any number in the address bar that they would eventually find salespeople whether they are listed or unlisted.

Vulnerability #2: Cross-Site Request Forgery
